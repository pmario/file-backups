## V0.4.0 What's New

 - The plugin, if downloaded in the background, will only be installed and activated at browser restart
 - Memory leak fixed for frequently saved huge TWs
 - File-Backups AddOn only uses 1 icon - The browser "diamond" icon
 - The "diamond" icon gets an "orange" !-indicator
   - The drop-down will show eg: new version ;)
 - An "out of order" backup is created if a TiddlyWiki is saved for the first time
   - Only different names are detected.
   - If the AddOn is uninstalled and installed again the first save will create an "out of order" backup per new name.
 - Backups are activated by default if the AddOn is installed
 - Default number of backups was increased from 6 to 7
 - The plugin Options setting site was updated
 - AddOn should work for "FireFox for Android"
   - At least it does for me ;)
